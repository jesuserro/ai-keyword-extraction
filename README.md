# 🔑 AI-Powered Keyword Extraction with OpenAI

Welcome to the **Keyword Extraction Project**, where we use the power of OpenAI's ChatCompletion API to extract keywords from any given text. This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates how to interact with the API and retrieve keywords efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- **Keyword Extraction**: Provide a block of text, get back its main keywords.
- **Lightweight & Minimal**: Only a few dependencies needed.
- **Easily Customizable**: Adjust the model, temperature, and prompt instructions.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keyword-extraction-project.git
   cd keyword-extraction-project
   ```

2. **Set up your virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set your OpenAI API key**:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory with the line:

     ``` text
     OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     ```

     **OR** export it directly in your shell:

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the main script**:
  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Observe the output**: You will see a printed list of keywords extracted from the sample text in `main.py`.

3. **Customize**:
   - Modify the `input_text` variable in `main.py` with your own text.
   - Adjust parameters such as `model`, `temperature`, and `max_tokens` inside the `extract_keywords` function to fit your needs.
   - If you prefer to run it in a Jupyter Notebook, simply copy the relevant code into a `.ipynb` file.
